    "# Application Programming Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "You will hear the term \"API\" in many different contexts when it comes to computer programming. Already in this class, we have discussed Python's API for the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, however, when someone mentions an API, they are referring to a web-based API that is usually accessed over HTTP(S). You might have heard about the kerfuffle when Twitter shut down much of the access to its API, or when Reddit did the same thing a few years earlier. These APIs are servers that provide _interfaces_ (the \"I\" in \"API\") to a platform's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you probably noticed while reading @Walker2019, it is not exactly uncommon for references to APIs to become out of date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, we can still use the API provided by the [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la) for our work for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with the Python [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library, which provides its own easy-to-use API for making HTTP requests. In other words, it's APIs all the way down.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting an access token\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, APIs will ask that you first obtain a key to use them. Even if APIs offer unlimited requests, it is important for them to require users to supply an API key so that they can track (often anonymized) usage statistics, errors, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, APIs require you to pay, either immediately or after making a certain number of requests. Keys can be used to track usage for payment calculations, too. For an example of this system, see OpenAI's [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### An API Key for DPLA\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll work with the Digital Public Library of America's (DPLA) API. Take a few minutes to read through their [API Basics](https://pro.dp.la/developers/api-basics), then request an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Request types\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that you must submit a `POST` request to receive an API key. `POST` is one of several HTTP verbs. When you enter a URL into a web browser and hit \"Enter,\" you're typically issuing a `GET` request: `GET` requests do not have a request body; they simply ask for the information at the provided URL, perhaps with some query parameters (the `key=value` pairs after a `?` in the URL).\n",
    "\n",
    "`POST` requests, by contrast, _may_ contain a request body. You've probably submitted `POST` requests without knowing it whenever you sign up for a new service. That's essentially what we're doing with DPLA here, we're just doing it from the command line instead of through an interface that DPLA has built.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPLA [documentation](https://pro.dp.la/developers/policies#get-a-key) instructs you to submit a request using `curl`, but we don't have access to `curl` from this notebook. Instead, let's make the request using the Python \"Requests\" library."
