    "## TF-IDF - An Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF, is a powerful, if deceptively simple, way of determining keywords in a text. As its name suggests, it is comprised of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Term Frequency (TF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of times that a term — typically, a token or a phrase — appears in a document. We can normalize this using various techniques. Generally speaking, we want to use the _relative_ frequency, or the raw frequency divided by the number of terms in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Frequency (DF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of documents in which a term appears. Again, there are common normalizations that we will typically perform, such as adding a small ε value to avoid dividing by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Inverse_ document frequency, or IDF, is just the multiplicative inverse, or reciprocal, of DF.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, IDF is usually logarithmically scaled, i.e., $IDF=\\log(n/DF)$ where $n$ is the number of documents in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prefatory matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a sense of a basic implementation of TF-IDF, we first need some text to work with. To get some text, we'll need to review a few things about Python, and we'll need to learn how to use the `lxml` library to get text out of TEI XML files — the kinds of files that store much of the textual data and metadata that we use in digital humanities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install `lxml`\n",
    "\n",
    "`%pip` (note the `%`) is a special command built into Jupyter notebooks that lets us use the Python package manager `pip`.\n",
